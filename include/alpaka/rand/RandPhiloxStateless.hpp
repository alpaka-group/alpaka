    /** Most common Philox engine variant, stateless, outputs a 4-vector of floats
     *
     * This is a variant of the Philox engine generator which outputs a vector containing 4 floats. The counter
     * size is \f$4 \times 32 = 128\f$ bits. Since the engine returns the whole generated vector, it is up to the
     * user to extract individual floats as they need. The benefit is smaller state size since the state does not
     * contain the intermediate results. The total size of the state is 192 bits = 24 bytes.
