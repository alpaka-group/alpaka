### Breaking Changes
- C++14 is no longer supported (see above)
- alpaka now uses Boost.Atomic by default if the latter can be found by CMake. This can be turned off by passing `-DALPAKA_ACC_CPU_DISABLE_ATOMIC_REF=ON` during the CMake configuration phase. #1566

- Removed the `alpaka::extent` namespace (the contents now live in the main `alpaka` namespace) #1593
- Kernel arguments are required to be trivially copyable. This was always a requirement but is now enforced by alpaka #1635
- All alpaka-specific CMake variables follow the `${PROJECT_NAME}_VARIABLE_FOO_BAR` pattern. This means that all alpaka-specific CMake variables look like this: `alpaka_VARIABLE_FOO_BAR`. #1653
- `alpaka::getWarpSize()` was renamed to `alpaka::getWarpSizes()` and now returns a vector of supported warp sizes #1644
- `alpaka::clock()` is now deprecated and will be removed in the next release. The compiler will warn about its usage. #1645
- Renamed namespace `traits` to `trait` #1651
- Removed support for `std::function` kernel functions #1654
- Kernel functions are required to be trivially copyable. With the exception of `std::function` (see bullet point directly above) this was always a requirement but is now enforced by alpaka. #1654

### Bugs Fixed:
- fixed multiple bugs where CPU streams/events could deadlock or behaved different than the native CUDA events
- fixed a bug where the block synchronization of the Boost.Fiber backend crashed due to uninitialized variables

### New Features / Enhancements:
- added support for stream callbacks allowing to enqueue arbitrary host code using alpaka::stream::enqueue(stream, [&](){...});
- added support for compiling for multiple architectures using e.g. ALPAKA_CUDA_ARCH="20;35"
- added support for using __host__ constexpr code within __device__ code
- enhanced the CUDA error handling
- enhanced the documentation for mapping CUDA to alpaka

### Compatibility Changes:
- added support for CUDA 9.0 and 9.1
- added support for CMake 3.9 and 3.10
- removed support for CMake 3.6 and older
- added support for boost-1.65.0
- removed support for boost-1.61.0 and older
- added support for gcc 7
- added support for clang 4 and 5
- removed support for VS2015


## [0.2.0] - 2017-06-19
### Compatibility fixes and small enhancements:
- the documentation has been greatly enhanced
- adds support for CUDA 8.0
- adds support for CMake versions 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8
- adds support for Boost 1.62, 1.63 and 1.64
- adds support for clang-3.9
- adds support for Visual Studio 2017
- alpaka now compiles clean even with clang -Weverything
- re-enabled the boost::fiber accelerator backend which was disabled in the last release

### API changes:
- mapIdx is moved from namespace alpaka::core to alpaka::idx
- Vec is moved from namespace alpaka to alpaka::vec
- vec::Vec is now allowed to be zero-dimensional (was previously forbidden)
- added vec::concat
- added element-wise operator< for vec::Vec which returns a vector of bool
- CPU accelerators now support arbitrary dimensionality (both kernel execution as well as memory operations)
- added support for syncBlockThreadsPredicate with block::sync::op::LogicalOr, block::sync::op::LogicalAnd and block::sync::op::Count
- memory allocations are now aligned optimally for the underlying architecture (16 bit for SSE, 32 bit for AVX, 64 bit for AVX512) instead of 16 bit for all architectures in the previous release
