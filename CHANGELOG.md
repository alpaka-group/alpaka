The namespace structure of *alpaka* is now flattened. 
The [script](https://gist.github.com/sliwowitz/0a55e1bed6350f7fcae17ef0d430040d) can help you to apply the changes to your code.
The script only works if you used the full namespace `alpaka::*` for alpaka functions.

- renamed alpaka::kernel::createTaskExec to alpaka::kernel::createTaskKernel
- QueueCpuSync now correctly blocks when called from multiple threads
  - This broke some previous use-cases (e.g. usage within existing OpenMP parallel regions)
  - This use case can now be handled with the support for external CPU queues as can bee seen in the example QueueCpuOmp2CollectiveImpl
- previously it was possible to have kernels return values even though they were always ignored. Now kernels are checked to always return void
- renamed all files with *Stl suffix to *StdLib
- renamed BOOST_ARCH_CUDA_DEVICE to BOOST_ARCH_PTX
- executors have been renamed due to the upcoming standard C++ feature with a different meaning. All files within alpaka/exec/ have been moved to alpaka/kernel/ and the files and classes have been renamed from Exec* to TaskKernel*. This should not affect users of alpaka but will affect extensions.
